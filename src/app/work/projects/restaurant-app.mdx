## Summary

This project focuses on streamlining the design-to-code process for a restaurant mobile application. By leveraging Figma’s powerful design tools, we established an efficient pipeline that ensures clean, production-ready code while maintaining design integrity. Our approach integrates design tokens, reusable components, and automated workflows to accelerate development and reduce errors.## Enlaces de Figma

## Key Features

- **Interactive Menu System** – Browse dishes with high-quality images and descriptions to enhance the food-ordering experience.
- **Customizable Ordering & Reservations** – Easily place orders, select meal preferences, and book tables with real-time availability.
- **Optimized User Interface** – A modern, intuitive UI designed in Figma and translated into production-ready code.
- **Automated Design-to-Code Workflow** – Extract styles, components, and layouts directly from Figma to streamline development.
- **Consistent Brand Identity** – Maintain brand consistency across the app with a structured design system.
- **Dark & Light Mode Support** – Custom themes allow users to switch between dark and light modes for a personalized experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma API** – Extract and sync restaurant-themed UI components directly from designs.
- **Styled-Components** – Apply and dynamically manage branding and design elements for a seamless aesthetic.
- **React Native** – Develop the mobile application with reusable UI components for a smooth user experience.
- **GitHub Actions** – Automate updates from Figma to ensure design changes are reflected instantly.
- **Firebase** – Store user preferences, orders, and reservation data securely.
- **Stripe API** – Enable seamless and secure payment processing for online orders.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was ensuring a smooth UI-to-code transition without compromising performance and responsiveness. Handling complex menu structures and reservation functionalities required careful architecture planning and component optimization. This project reinforced the importance of a structured design system to streamline restaurant app development.
## Outcome

This restaurant mobile app transforms the food-ordering and reservation process through seamless integration of Figma design principles and automation. Developers benefit from reduced design translation time, while users enjoy a visually engaging and highly functional app experience.

This project showcases the power of automation in streamlining workflows.
